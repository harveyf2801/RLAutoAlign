# Use either a (on/off) Policy Gradient-Based DRL like TRPO, GA3C or PPO
# or a Value-Based DRL like Ape-X DQfD or DARQN to train the network

# DQN / DDQN is usually used for audio based DRL tasks as they're easier
# to implement however, the above algorithms are generally more efficient.

# https://github.com/TianhongDai/reinforcement-learning-algorithms provides
# a variety of DRL algorithms to choose from.
